        <b>Unity</b> is a cross-platform game engine developed by Unity Technologies, first announced and released in
        June 2005 at Apple Inc.'s Worldwide Developers Conference as a Mac OS X-exclusive game engine. As of 2018, the
        engine had been extended to support more than 25 platforms. The engine can be used to create three-dimensional,
        two-dimensional, virtual reality, and augmented reality games, as well as simulations and other experiences. The
        engine has been adopted by industries outside video gaming, such as film, automotive, architecture, engineering
        and construction.
